# Embedded Speaker Recognition System

This repository contains the implemntation of a speaker recongnition system. The idea is not clear, but the main objectif is to successfully recognize the speaker using and descovering various techniques and algorithms, to eventually build a robust system and integrate it on an embbended system.



# Efficient ML

This repository also contains my learning on advanced efficient ML.
