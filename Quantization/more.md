### Static Vs Dynamic Quantization

[Static vs Dynamic Quantization](https://selek.tech/posts/static-vs-dynamic-quantization-in-machine-learning/)

_Static quantization_ converts the weights and activates of a neural network to lower precision during the training or post-training phase. 

_Dynamic quantization_ quantizes only the weights to a lower precision and leaves the activations in floating-point during the modelâ€™s runtime.
